# MOTHER-3-Battle-Sprite-Graphics
ConsolePNGConv is an Inserter that will let you put the enemy sprites you want inside MOTHER 3.
Just put your sprite in the same folder as the Inserter and the MOTHER 3 ROM, this program will make sure 
everything is put correctly inside the ROM.
The Inserter creates its own space inside the MOTHER 3's ROM, so there won't be conflicts with other tools.
It's written in C#.
